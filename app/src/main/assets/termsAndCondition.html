            <p class="white">A student should never compromise on the quality of his education because of financial constraints. He can seek financial assistance from banks by taking an educational loan. However, banks may not provide loans if the student wants to pursue skill-based professional courses such as computer technology,&nbsp;banking , healthcare or any&nbsp;job related course.&nbsp;Here is where Eduvanz lends a helping hand. We strive to&nbsp;provide education loans for skill-based training according to the requirements of the student.</p>

            <header><h5 class="footer-headings" >What is a student loan?</h5></header>
            <p class="white">A&nbsp;student&nbsp;loan also known as&nbsp;Student Education Loan, is the money lent by&nbsp;banks or other NBFCs&nbsp;to students so that they can pay for&nbsp;their&nbsp;educational fees&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="white">Eduvanz is well-known for providing the best services for student loans.</p>
            <p class="white">We offer private student Loan to students belonging to Mumbai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad, Pune, Delhi&nbsp;etc.</p>

            <header><h5 class="footer-headings" >How to apply for a student loan?</h5></header>
            <p class="white">The students can&nbsp;apply for student loan&nbsp;in a bank or a non-banking financial institution.&nbsp;But applying for loans in banks is a tedious job. The list of documents may vary from one bank to another. However,&nbsp;we have removed such complicated steps and application of loans are&nbsp;very easy and efficient with our loan approval process.</p>

            <p class="white">We provide&nbsp;loans&nbsp;at&nbsp;low&nbsp;interests. The student can easily understand&nbsp;how to get a student loan&nbsp;by visiting our website&nbsp;www.eduvanz.com</p>

            <p class="white">The approval can be provided instantly to have a&nbsp;same day loan.&nbsp;Availing an education loan from Eduvanz is a simple and hassle-free process — it can be availed very quickly.</p>
