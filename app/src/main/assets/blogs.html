<b><h3>Educational loans – solution to many problems </h3></b>

                <p>The very reason why one applies for an educational loan is that of lack of money source. It is a pity to see such a number of students drop out of their education in the middle of their studies just because their family cannot pay the fee. Due to this many students get psychologically affected which leads them to accumulate stress and depression. The worst case scenario is some students even commit suicide as they no longer know what to do and because their dreams have been shattered.
